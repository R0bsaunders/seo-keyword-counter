                    <h2>Using the keyword counter tool</h2>
                    <p>Using the search-term counter couldn't be easier. You choose where to start; either by adding your keywords one at a time (for now) or simply start writing your search-engine optimised content and add your keywords later. Don't worry about losing your content as it is automatically saved to your browser's memory as you type. As long as you don't delete your browser or clear it's history, your copy should stay there as long as you need it.
                        <br>
                    When you add a keyword before entering any content, you'll notice the background colour of the keywords's container is red. This indicates no matches have been found in your content. The background will turn green when a match is found, and the number of occurrences will be updated.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Enter your keyword or search term into the keyword box and press enter or hit the 'Add Keyword' button (one at a time for now)</li>
                        <li>Each search term will appear under the large text entry area</li>
                        <li>Click 'Clear Keywords' to remove all of the keywords you added (note this removes them from memory too)</li>
                        <li>Each individual search-term you add can be deleted by clicking the little dustbin icon</li>
                        <li>Now you can either start writing your content directly into the text box, or do it my way and simply paste a load of content into it for an instant analysis. Then modify as you see fit</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>About the Keyword Counter tool</h2>
                    <p>This keyword counting has been created to give SEOs and content-writers the ability to instantly visualise how many times they have used specific keywords and keyphrases. As an SEO myself, I often found myself quickly forgetting what content I have written and getting extremely frustrated with re-reading what I'd written over and over again, desperately trying to keep track of which keywords I have already used and how often. <br>
                    So this tool aims to take away that frustration. I built it to solve my problem so hopefully, it will help you too.</p>
