## Description
This SEO Keyword Density (counter) tool is specifically designed to help SEOs count the number of times they have used their list of keywords/phrases when writing keyword-rich and search engine optimised content. As the SEO types/pastes in their copy, this app displays the number of times they have used each keyword/phrase within their copy - In real-time. Any number of keywords can be counted, and the keywords can be single-words and/or contain multiple words. The tool won’t include partial matches where the keyword matches a combination of letters within a word for example, if an SEO is tracking the word ‘the’, the app won’t match it to ‘thesaurus’.

To prevent any lost-data and lost-time frustrations, all user inputs are saved to local storage in real-time just in case there are any tekkie issues like a computer crash or an accidental browser/tab closure.

This tool is obviously not the first of its kind or anything ground-breaking etc, but I built it to practise my JavaScript knowledge and apply it to a real-world problem. As an SEO myself, I often write content that must include certain keywords but with my memory, I quickly forget which ones I’ve used and end up re-reading my copy repeatedly trying to gauge which words/phrases I’ve used on my list. It’s important not to use too many of the same word, so it quickly becomes difficult for me to keep track of how many I’ve used.

So, I knew I could Google it and probably find a tool that could do this already but for me it was the perfect opportunity to apply my knowledge and build something I (and maybe others) can use without trials or cost. Again, though, it’s amateur and of course not nearly as feature-rich as those professional versions - but it only needs to be simple.
